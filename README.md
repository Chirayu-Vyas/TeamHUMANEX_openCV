The essence of the Humanex project revolves around crafting a life-sized 
humanoid prototype. Our objective is to design a robot that not only mirrors a 
human-like appearance but also possesses the ability to engage in 
conversations, process data inputs, recognize faces, interpret voices, and 
execute actions based on commands. To achieve this, our robot is equipped 
with an array of sensors, including cameras, microphones, and tactile sensors, 
enabling it to perceive its surroundings and interact seamlessly with people.
The project proceeds through several stages, encompassing conceptualization, 
design, software development, programming, and rigorous testing. Our 
ultimate goal is to create a robot capable of performing a broad spectrum of 
practical tasks in diverse environments, ranging from homes and offices to 
factories and hospitals.
Fundamentally, we aim to infuse this humanoid creation with what we often 
term the "sixth sense," achieved through the integration of artificial 
intelligence, with a primary focus on leveraging the capabilities of 'ChatGPT.'
In my new role within this project, my responsibilities focus on refining the 
robot's movements to emulate a more natural, human-like motion. 
Additionally, I am diligently working on establishing a stable connection 
between two microcontrollers. This connection will streamline workload 
sharing, ultimately eliminating the need for a heavier and more expensive 
processing unit.
This transition into the world of Humans, or "Seetha's Eye," represents an 
exhilarating shift in my journey within the Robotics Club. It's a journey where I 
actively contribute to the realization of innovative humanoid robot, pushing 
the boundaries of what we can achieve.
